            As far as technical aspects are considered, Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. I have mostly worked in back-end, but I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.

            As far as as my hobbies are concerned, I'm very much interested in hindi and urdu literature. I have been writing shayris, ghazals and kavitas for nearly 2 years.
            I write in varied subjects such as romantic, sad, nature loving, social problems etc.
